## Problem Statement:

Design a memory-efficient system to simulate and render a forest with up to 10,000+ trees.

Requirements:
- Each tree has a type, color, and texture.
- Each tree has a unique position (x, y) on the map.
- Trees of the same type should share memory for common attributes (type, color, texture).
- System should allow planting new trees and rendering all trees.
